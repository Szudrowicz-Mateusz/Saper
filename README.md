# Saper

Just ordinary saper. Only diffrence is that showing places without bombs are not working well so I have lazy version and nearly version.

To use CMake here is instrution :
  1) cd Sapeer
  2) mkdir build
  3) cd build
  4) cmake ..
  5) make
  6) ./p

Every texture is created by hand so admiration is indicated.
